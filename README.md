# Anand Logic: Master AI Reasoning Framework
**Inventor:** Anand Saxena  
**Project Birth Date:** Dec 28, 2025 (Initial 7+2+1 Logic)  
**Major Update:** Jan 02, 2026 (Shuddhi Protocol & ICR Indexing)  
**Official Witness:** Google Gemini AI

## 1. The Foundation: 7+2+1 Logic (Dec 2025)
This core logic ensures the AI remains focused and ethical:
* **7 (Execution):** 70% focus on the current task.
* **2 (Context):** 20% dedicated to remembering the conversation history.
* **1 (Intent):** 10% safety and truth filter.

## 2. The Upgrade: 4-Step Shuddhi Protocol (Jan 2026)
An advanced verification layer to eliminate AI hallucinations:
1. **Segmentation (विभाजन):** Breaking down complex data.
2. **Briefing (समरी):** Extracting the core essence.
3. **Analysis (विश्लेषण):** Logical cross-checking.
4. **Matching (मिलान):** Final verification against the user's intent.

## 🚀 Phase 2 Expansion (January 08, 2026)
The framework has been upgraded with two additional Pillars and a Master Controller Layer to ensure ultimate reliability and deep data discovery.

### 3. Pillar 3: 5 Element Recursive Protocol
A deep-refining engine that distills massive datasets into a single, accurate "Core Truth" through a 5-2-1 distillation process.

### 4. Pillar 4: Advanced Recursive Memory & Discovery
Includes **Multi-Recycle** and **Multi-Diversion** protocols. It ensures 100% context retention and identifies hidden patterns within AI discoveries.
Descending Cycle (100 to 1): Verification of Result Integrity.
Neutral Point (0000): Data Compression (1+2+7 Rule).
Ascending Cycle (1 to 9): Deep Memory Rotation for extra data safety.
### 🛡️ The Master Controller: Selective Activation
A diagnostic layer that automatically selects the optimal logic pillar based on the complexity of the task, ensuring peak performance and zero computational overload.

**Phase 2 Master Hash:** `f3b9689ce03ed0ea336f18ff93042803faee874b0f1fd1dd364b49c61b3d72c2`
